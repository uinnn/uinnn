Hello! My name is José Carrara but commonly knowed as uin! 
I a'm a Kotlin programmer, but i know three other languages, such as Java, JavaScript and C#. I also love cats! 🐱

📖 I'm currently studying new ways to implement and facilitate the rapid productivity that Kotlin offers for uses with Minecraft plugins.
Three of five planned frameworks is complete, you can see a list below:

- [serializer-framework](https://github.com/uinnn/serializer-framework) ✔️ A kotlin serializer (as configuration) framework for spigot or standalone use.
- [interface-framework](https://github.com/uinnn/interface-framework) ✔️ A complex and complete kotlin interface (inventory) framework for spigot.
- [instructor-framework](https://github.com/uinnn/instructor-framework) ✔️ A useful very simple way to create instructors (commands) in spigot with kotlin.
- database-framework :x: A lightweight and asynchronous kotlin database framework using Kotlin Exposed and HikariCP for spigot.
- spigot-common :x: A set of common utilities and fast developing for spigot.

If any of my frameworks helped or interested you, please contribute by giving me a star! :star:
