Hello! My name is uinnn! I a'm a Kotlin programmer, but i know three other languages, such as Java, JavaScript and C#. I also love cats! 🐱

📖 I'm currently studying new ways to implement and facilitate the rapid productivity that Kotlin offers for uses with Minecraft plugins.
Only one of four planned frameworks is complete, you can see the a list below:

- serializer-framework ✔️ A kotlin serializer (as configuration) framework for spigot or standalone use.
- interface-framework :x: A complex and complete kotlin interface (inventory) framework for spigot.
- database-framework :x: A lightweight and fast kotlin database framework using Kotlin Exposed and HikariCP.
- spigot-common :x: A set of common utilities and fast developing for spigot.

If any of my frameworks helped or interested you, please contribute by giving me a star! :star:
